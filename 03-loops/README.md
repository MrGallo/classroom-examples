- Print out something 100 times (**counter variable**)
- Create a loop to count from 0 to 10
- Count from 0 to 100 by 5
- Calculate the sum of the numbers from 1-10 (**accumulator variable**)
- `break` out of a loop
- Skip loop code (`continue`)
- Add up user input in a loop
- **Iterate** over a collection (lists, strings)
- Convert a while loop to a for loop
- Convert a for loop to a while loop

## Advanced
- For loop with `enumerate()`
