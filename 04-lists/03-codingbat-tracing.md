# Codingbat Solution Tracing
This is a collection of [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com) solutions that may or may not work. 
The idea is to trace the code to discover the errors or to determine if the solution is infact correct.

## Adding a post
Simply edit this document and add your code as shown below with the following rules:
1. Ensure your code is within triple backticks like below. 
2. Add [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for the function header so we know what type of data the function recieves and returns.
3. Ensure that the name of the function is under an appropriate `###` header.
4. Ensure that the problem's explanation text is above all the "solutions". 
5. Keep the problems in alpha order.

## Example:
### double
Create a function that will double the given integer.
```
double(5) -> 10
double(3) -> 6
double(0) -> 0
```
Solutions:

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 2
```

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 1
```
### no23:
Given an int array length 2, return True if it does not contain a 2 or 3.

Solutions:

```python
def no23(no23[int]): -> no23[int]:
    for i in no23:
        if i == 2 or i == 3:
            return False
            break
    return True
```
           


End example
